# Dotfiles
An initial pass at my dotfiles for Arch, using `i3-gaps` window manager.

## Setup
Clone the repo, navigate to it, then run `./install.sh`, which will symlink the dotfiles into your `$HOME`, provided they're not already present (use the `-f` option to forcefully overwrite any existing versions of those files).

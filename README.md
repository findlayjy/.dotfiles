# Dotfiles
An initial pass at my dotfiles for Arch, using `i3-gaps` window manager.

## Setup
Clone the repo, navigate to it, then run `./install.sh`, which will symlink the dotfiles into your `$HOME`, provided they're not already present (use the `-f` option to forcefully overwrite any existing versions of those files).

## Missing repos
Need to clone [`ranger_devicons`](https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons) into `.config/ranger/plugins/ranger_devicons` and [`Themes`](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes) into `.config/spicetify/Themes`.

# Dotfiles
Some dotfiles for my linux system. Currently using Pop!\_OS.

- rc files for `zsh` and `vim`.
- custom theme file for `zsh`.
- Nord dircolors.
- Config files for `alacritty` terminal emulator, `albert` launcher, `neofetch` and `ranger`, along with my `autostart` settings.

## Setup
Clone the repo, navigate to it, then run `./install.sh`, which will symlink the dotfiles into your `$HOME`, provided they're not already present (use the `-f` option to forcefully overwrite any existing versions of those files).
